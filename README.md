# Even

Hello, welcome to Even.

This is a program that will tell you if the positive number you've input is Even.

It works by taking the input number and counting down 1 at a time, alternating an Odd or Even count, until zero.  Once zero, the Odd or Even flag is called to proclaim the evenness of the input number and End.
