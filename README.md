# Even

Hello, welcome to Even.

This is a program that will tell you if the positive number you've input is Even.

It works by taking the input number and counting down 1 at a time, alternating an Odd or Even count, until zero.  Once zero, the Odd or Even flag is called to proclaim the evenness of the input number and End.

9/30/2016: % operating in JavaScript will easily be able to tell if a number is even by finding out if there is no remainder.  For instance: 20 % 2 would return zero, which then tells that the input 20 is even.
